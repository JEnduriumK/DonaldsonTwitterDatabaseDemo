### 2. Current System
The current system that we have employed is one that has an interaction with tweepy in order to pull tweets from twitter. It then puts those tweets that it has pulled into a database. This database contains different labels for different types of tweets and the typical information of those tweets (date,tweetID,authorID,etc). After these tweets have been entered into the database another function will run through the current tweets and perfom a type of sentiment analysis on the individual tweets. The function then gives scores to determine whether the tweet was an overall positive one or a negative one. Now in one of our final systems to be currently implemented. There is a function that goes through the text of the tweets within the database. If it is to recognize a keyword it then puts a label of what powertrain set that user could possibly be tweeting about which would make it much easier for the Donaldson to see what their companies that they like are talking about and maybe even working on.
